## Codex execution contract

**CGS-10 runtime and consent contract:** Treat subsequent Claude-specific tool syntax as source procedure, not automatic execution. Resolve the selected project root explicitly; use the registered helper dispatcher with `--root <project-root>` when available. Observe real files and diagnostics; never turn a failed probe or unknown code root into an empty project. If a required helper cannot run, use an explicitly documented factual fallback only where the needed facts and precedence can be established; otherwise report NOT ASSESSED and stop that dependent step. Use native question support when available or ask in plain text and wait. A skipped or dismissed required decision is not consent; preserve prior explicit user authorization and active host permissions. Never auto-run another skill or phase after a recommendation.

This adaptation preserves upstream sources: do not edit CLAUDE.md, .claude files, generated .agents reference mirrors, or generated role files as project configuration. The original CLAUDE stack/import and agent-file steps below are historical Claude procedures: replace them with resolving engine/version/language and specialist routing from project.yaml and reading the appropriate pinned VERSION.md on demand. Record the actual editor version, executable or probe method and time in the user-owned docs/project/engine-version.md when authorized; this record complements the pinned reference and does not assert that its documentation was refreshed. Keep the guided user choices, confirmation, version/installation checks, scoped authorized project.yaml and project artifact writes, reference-update safeguards and coherence reporting. If the original legacy technical-preferences dual-write cannot be performed without modifying a generated/source-owned file, do not modify the legacy mirror; project.yaml and the user-owned version probe record are the Codex equivalent, with legacy mirror parity explicitly PENDING. Do not propose or claim a mirror update unless an independently user-owned writable destination is established. Never overwrite an existing Godot project, never fabricate Unity/Unreal projects, and do not execute a suggested next skill. Verify current release/licensing claims against official sources rather than presenting historical prices as current.

Resolve the intended project root before executing relative paths: prefer the nearest project containing project.yaml or project.local.yaml, including a nested project; do not silently borrow a parent project. Execute the explicit bootstrap steps in this document before consuming their output. Native Codex does not perform shell preprocessing. Original tool capability scope: `Read, Glob, Grep, Write, Edit, WebSearch, WebFetch, Agent, user-question facility, Bash(bash "*/.agents/skills/setup-engine/../../hooks/yaml-helper.sh" resolve_config *), Bash(godot --version), Bash(godot --headless --path . --import), Bash(command -v godot), Bash(uname -s), Bash(bash .agents/scripts/project-coherence.sh*)`. Treat this as a ceiling for this skill, not a permission grant; preserve any narrower read-only restriction in the body and the active host permissions. Use a user-question facility when available, otherwise ask in plain text and wait; unanswered required decisions are not consent. Use native subagents only when available and authorized; otherwise read the relevant role and work in-session, disclosing lack of independent review. Upstream slash-command references mean invoke the corresponding installed Codex skill using its $name; do not assume all skills have been migrated. Source argument guidance: "[engine] | [engine version] | refresh | upgrade [old-version] [new-version] | no args for guided selection". 


# Engine Setup

When this skill is invoked:

**Explicit bootstrap (execute before using this output, from the resolved project root):** `bash ".agents/hooks/yaml-helper.sh" resolve_config --keys workflow`. If unavailable, report the missing dependency and do not invent results.

**Tier awareness.** The `workflow` tier resolved above governs which design
artifact this skill expects and the finish path it recommends in §12:
- **`minimal`** — the design artifact is the one-page `design/game-brief.md`
  (no GDDs, systems decomposition, or per-system design at this tier).
  `$setup-engine` runs *first* in the minimal path, so a missing brief here is
  normal, not a gap. The finish path is the 4-step floor.
- **`standard` / `full`** — the design artifact is `design/gdd/game-concept.md`
  and the finish path is the full pipeline.

If the block did not render (shell preprocessing disabled), assume `minimal` (the default).

## 1. Parse Arguments

Four modes:

- **Full spec**: `$setup-engine godot 4.7` — engine and version provided
- **Engine only**: `$setup-engine unity` — engine provided, version will be looked up
- **No args**: `$setup-engine` — fully guided mode (engine recommendation + version)
- **Refresh**: `$setup-engine refresh` — update reference docs (see Section 10)
- **Upgrade**: `$setup-engine upgrade [old-version] [new-version]` — migrate to a new engine version (see Section 11)

## 2. Guided Mode (No Arguments)

**Read `references/2-guided-mode.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## 9. Update Agent Instructions

Ask: "May I add a Version Awareness section to the engine specialist agent files?" before making any edits.

For the chosen engine's specialist agents, verify they have a
"Version Awareness" section. If not, add one following the pattern in
the existing Godot specialist agents.

The section should instruct the agent to:
1. Read `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md`
2. Check deprecated APIs before suggesting code
3. Check breaking changes for relevant version transitions
4. Use WebSearch to verify uncertain APIs

---

## 10. Refresh Subcommand

If invoked as `$setup-engine refresh`:

1. Read the existing `docs/engine-reference/<engine>/VERSION.md` to get
   the current engine and version
2. Use WebSearch to check for:
   - New engine releases since last verification
   - Updated migration guides
   - Newly deprecated APIs
3. Update all reference docs with new findings
4. Update "Last verified" dates on all modified files
5. Report what changed

## Guardrails

- NEVER guess an engine version — always verify via WebSearch or user confirmation
- `project.yaml` is the primary config store (v1.1). Always dual-write engine
  config to BOTH `project.yaml` (primary) and `technical-preferences.md` (legacy
  mirror). If the two ever diverge, `project.yaml` is authoritative.
- NEVER overwrite existing reference docs without asking — append or update
- If reference docs already exist for a different engine, ask before replacing
- Always show the user what you're about to change before making CLAUDE.md edits
- If WebSearch returns ambiguous results, show the user and let them decide
- When the user chose **GDScript**: copy the GDScript CLAUDE.md template from **A1** in `references/godot-language-config.md` exactly. NEVER add "C++ via GDExtension" to the Language field. GDScript projects may use GDExtension, but it is not a primary project language. The `godot-gdextension-specialist` in the routing table is available for when native extensions are needed — it does not make C++ a project language.

## Appendix A — Godot Language Configuration

Moved out of this file so it costs nothing on non-Godot runs.

**When the chosen engine is Godot, read**
`references/godot-language-config.md`
and use the subsection for the chosen language:

- **A1** — CLAUDE.md Technology Stack templates (GDScript / C# / Both)
- **A2** — naming conventions
- **A3** — engine specialist routing and file-extension tables

**Load discipline.** On any engine other than Godot, **never load it** — nothing in Sections 4, 5 or 5.5 needs it, and reading it anyway spends the tokens the split exists to save. On Godot, read it once when you first reach Section 4 and keep using it for Sections 5 and 5.5; do not re-read it at each reference.
